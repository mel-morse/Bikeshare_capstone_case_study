# Bikeshare capstone case study

## Project Summary
#### For my capstone project, I am analyzing a bikeshare dataset to understand how casual riders use the service compared to the annual members. The goal is to explore how their riding habits differ so the company can make better decisions about marketing, user experience, and ways to encourage more casual riders to become members. Since I’m still developing my skills, this project also gives me a chance to practice working with real data and applying what I’ve learned.

## Dataset Source
#### The dataset comes from a bikeshare company’s public trip data, which includes details about individual rides. Each record contains information such as trip start and end times, ride duration, starting and ending stations, and rider type (casual or member). It’s commonly used for learning because it’s realistic, large, and gives a good look at how people use shared transportation.
